<h1 id="issues-with-the-current-design">Issues with the current design</h1>
<p>(can I just use the table for this?)</p>

<h1 id="common-rare-use-cases-for-an-elevator">Common/ Rare use cases for an elevator</h1>
<h3 id="common">Common</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Move people to and from various floors of a building rapidly</li>
  <li>Lifting heavy / bulky objects to other floors of a building that otherwise could not be transported up the stairs by foot</li>
  <li>dumbwaiters are smaller elevators used to transport smaller items to and from floors (i.e. dishes and food plates in a nice hotel)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rare">Rare</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Freight elevators are used to transport heavier loads to great heights and back down (think of a carvana)</li>
  <li>Wheelchair platforms push the definition of an elevator but carry out the same function as well as provides ease of access for the disabled</li>
  <li>Paternoster elevators are used in factory plants to move manufacttured products to different floors in assembly lines</li>
</ul>

<p>The interface of an elevator if it is easy to read makes doing all of the common nad rare cases for elevator use easier, however in the event of a poor design the user of the elevaotr is left confused and takes a significant amount of time to properly operate it to accomplish their desired goal. In the event of an extremely poor design the elevator could be used wrong, and worse yet in the event of an emergency with a poor interface the user may be left panicking without idea on how to call for help.</p>

<h1 id="sequence-of-actions-usability-and-feedback">Sequence of actions, usability, and feedback</h1>
<h3 id="sequence-of-actions">Sequence of Actions</h3>
<p>As shown in the gif above, once the user enters the desired direction to travel in (up or down) and enters the elevator, they may press the desired floor to travel to and then decide if they want to shut the doors of the elevator early or keep them open with pushing the respective buttons.
In the event of an emergency or elevator getting stuck there will be another set of buttons to call the fire department and maintenence respectfully, both of these come with their set of instructions as well for the user to learn how to use them.</p>

<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>
<p>The elevator will support the user to figure out its design through using standard symbols and fonts for elevator designs, the floor the user is on will be labeled with a star for example. Descriptions for anything outside of which floor the user would like to travel to is always provided in the design of the interface.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Once the user selects their desired operation on the interface there is generally a light indicator that is turned on under the respective button that the user has selected as well as there is a direct change in the events happening with correlation to the selected choice, for example if the floor 2 button is pushed, the button the user pushed will light up and once the door closes the elevator will begin to move to floor 2.</p>

<h1 id="common-mistakes-with-current-design">Common mistakes with current design</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If the floor is labeled next to the button and has a squared layout (like my example) it is easy to press the wrong floor’s button and the user is forced to travel to the wrong floor</li>
  <li>The open/ close door buttons generally dont provide feeback that the user has pressed them and results in rapid pressing of the smae button which may not even work at all creating frustration</li>
  <li>In the event of an emergency the user is forced to read lengthy paragraphs to learn how to call for help, generally if there is a fire in the elevator no one is going to sit and read a book, theyre going to start slamming buttons out of confusion and fear.</li>
</ul>
