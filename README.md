| PROS | CONS |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to find fire operations buttons | The square layout of floor buttons is confusing |
| Call button easy to find and operate | Fire operations descriptions is lengthy and hard to read |
| Light to indicate button pressed on floors | Floor number should be on the button, not next to it, creates confusion |
|   | No light on oper/close door buttons |
|   | Cancel fire operation and call fire department buttons look too similar and in emergency the wrong one would be easily pressed |
|   | Bell button has no use | 

# Issues with the current design
(can I just use the table for this?)

# Common things elevators are used for
- Move people to and from various floors of a building rapidly
- Lifting heavy / bulky objects to other floors of a building that otherwise could not be transported up the stairs by foot
- dumbwaiters are smaller elevators used to transport smaller items to and from floors (i.e. dishes and food plates in a nice hotel)

# Rare uses
- Freight elevators are used to transport heavier loads to great heights and back down (think of a carvana) 
- Wheelchair platforms push the definition of an elevator but carry out the same function as well as provides ease of access for the disabled
- Paternoster elevators are used in factory plants to move manufacttured products to different floors in assembly lines

The interface of an elevator if it is easy to read makes doing all of the common nad rare cases for elevator use easier, however in the event of a poor design the user of the elevaotr is left confused and takes a significant amount of time to properly operate it to accomplish their desired goal. In the event of an extremely poor design the elevator could be used wrong, and worse yet in the event of an emergency with a poor interface the user may be left panicking without idea on how to call for help.
