| PROS | CONS |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to find fire operations buttons | The square layout of floor buttons is confusing |
| Call button easy to find and operate | Fire operations descriptions is lengthy and hard to read |
| Light to indicate button pressed on floors | Floor number should be on the button, not next to it, creates confusion |
|   | No light on open/close door buttons |
|   | Cancel fire operation and call fire department buttons look too similar and in emergency the wrong one would be easily pressed |
|   | Bell button has no use | 

# Issues with the current design
(can I just use the table for this?)

# Common/ Rare use cases for an elevator
### Common
- Move people to and from various floors of a building rapidly
- Lifting heavy / bulky objects to other floors of a building that otherwise could not be transported up the stairs by foot
- dumbwaiters are smaller elevators used to transport smaller items to and from floors (i.e. dishes and food plates in a nice hotel)

### Rare
- Freight elevators are used to transport heavier loads to great heights and back down (think of a carvana) 
- Wheelchair platforms push the definition of an elevator but carry out the same function as well as provides ease of access for the disabled
- Paternoster elevators are used in factory plants to move manufacttured products to different floors in assembly lines

The interface of an elevator if it is easy to read makes doing all of the common nad rare cases for elevator use easier, however in the event of a poor design the user of the elevaotr is left confused and takes a significant amount of time to properly operate it to accomplish their desired goal. In the event of an extremely poor design the elevator could be used wrong, and worse yet in the event of an emergency with a poor interface the user may be left panicking without idea on how to call for help.

# Sequence of actions, usability, and feedback
### Sequence of Actions
As shown in the gif above, once the user enters the desired direction to travel in (up or down) and enters the elevator, they may press the desired floor to travel to and the ndecide if they want to shut the doors of the elevator early or keep them open with pushing the respective buttons.
In the event of an emergency or elevator getting stuck there will be another set of buttons to call the fire department and maintenence respectfully, both of these come with their set of instructions as well for the user to learn how to use them.

### Usability
The elevator will support the user to figure out its design through using standard symbols and fonts for elevator designs, the floor the user is on will be labeled with a star for example. Descriptions for anything outside of which floor the user would like to travel to is always provided in the design of the interface.

### Feedback
Once the user selects their desired operation on the interface there is generally a light indicator that is turned on under the respective button that the user has selected as well as there is a direct change in the events happening with correlation to the selected choice, for example if the floor 2 button is pushed, the button the user pushed will light up and once the door closes the elevator will begin to move to floor 2.
