| PROS | CONS |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to find fire operations buttons | The square layout of floor buttons is confusing |
| Call button easy to find and operate | Fire operations descriptions is lengthy and hard to read |
| Light to indicate button pressed on floors | Floor number should be on the button, not next to it, creates confusion |
|   | No light on oper/close door buttons |
|   | Cancel fire operation and call fire department buttons look too similar and in emergency the wrong one would be easily pressed |
|   | Bell button has no use | 

# Issues with the current design
(can I just use the table for this?)

# Common things elevators are used for
- Move people to and from various floors of a building rapidly
- Lifting heavy / bulky objects to other floors of a building that otherwise could not be transported up the stairs by foot
- dumbwaiters are smaller elevators used to transport smaller items to and from floors (i.e. dishes and food plates in a nice hotel)

# Rare uses
- Freight elevators are used to transport heavier loads to great heights and back down (think of a carvana) 
- Wheelchair platforms push the definition of an elevator but carry out the same function as well as provides ease of access for the disabled
- Paternoster elevators are used in factory plants to move manufacttured products to different floors in assembly lines
