| PROS | CONS |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to find fire operations buttons | The square layout of floor buttons is confusing |
| Call button easy to find and operate | Fire operations descriptions is lengthy and hard to read |
| Light to indicate button pressed on floors | Floor number should be on the button, not next to it, creates confusion |
|   | No light on oper/close door buttons |
|   | Cancel fire operation and call fire department buttons look too similar and in emergency the wrong one would be easily pressed |
|   | Bell button has no use |
